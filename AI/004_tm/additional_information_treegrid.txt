Key Exploration Guidelines:
- There is a grid component with a hierarchy of elements, referred to as treegrid
- The treegrid has the CSS classes: treegrid, datatableworksheet, worksheet
- The treegrid has a hierarchy of elements in the rows; columns display the fields of every element
- Handle partially expanded rows
- Avoid redundant expansions

Special Considerations:
- The expand/collapse control is located to the left
- Use the '>>' ShowDetails button to display the 'Form View' panel
- Use the kebab menu (three vertical dots) for more options: expand, add objects to the tree
- Some tree elements may be collapsed, while others may be expanded
