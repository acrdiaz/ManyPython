INFO     [agent] 🚀 Starting task: Task: Get menu options from Income Tax folder's kebab menu

1. Navigate to:
   https://rc-sample.wktmdev.com/TeamMate/Project#/Project?assessmentId=11&assessmentState=1&projectId=4

2. Find the "Income Tax" folder in the treeview
   - Look specifically for "Income Tax" with a briefcase/folder icon next to it
   - Do NOT select any "Income Tax" item that has a different icon
   - Click directly on the row containing "Income Tax" with the briefcase icon to set focus
   - The row should highlight when focused

3. After focusing on the row:
   - Wait 1-2 seconds for the UI to update
   - Look for a kebab menu (three vertical dots) that appears on the right side of the row
   - The kebab menu button might have attributes like "data-auto-button" or "data-auto-contextualmenu"
   - Click ONLY on the kebab menu button (three vertical dots)

4. When the kebab menu dropdown opens:
   - The menu might appear as a popup or overlay
   - It might have attributes like "data-auto-menu" or similar
   - Take a screenshot to capture the menu
   - Extract the text of each menu option

5. Report your findings in JSON format:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "kebabMenuOptions": [
       "Option 1",
       "Option 2",
       "Option 3"
     ]
   }
   ```
   - The exact text of each menu option
   - If any step fails, describe what you see instead
