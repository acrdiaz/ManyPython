1. Navigate to:
   https://rc-sample.wktmdev.com/TeamMate/Project#/Project?assessmentId=11&assessmentState=1&projectId=4

2. Strict rules:
   - Absolutely no scrolling allowed (no scroll_up or scroll_down)
   - Only interact with elements fully visible in the viewport
   - If elements aren't fully visible, report them as not found

3. Locate the treeview container:
   - Find div with class "tv-treeview" (must be in viewport)
   - Verify data-auto-treeview attribute

4. Locate the treegrid within the treeview:
   - Find div with class "tv-treegrid" (must be in viewport)
   - Verify data-auto-treegrid attribute
   - Check for header div with class "tv-treegrid-header" (must be in viewport)

5. Check for elements in the treegrid:
   - Count how many rows are visible in the treegrid
   - Identify if there is a hierarchical structure (parent-child relationships)
   - Check if any rows have expand/collapse controls
   - Report the data-row-id and data-object-type of visible rows

6. Verify visible columns (must be in viewport):
   - Title
   - State
   - Document
   - Test Manager
   - Tester
   - Due Date

7. Check key elements (must be in viewport):
   - Search button (data-auto-button="317")
   - Resizable columns (tm-cols-resizable)

Failure conditions:
   - If elements require scrolling to be visible, report them as not found
   - If scrolling is attempted, terminate the task immediately
