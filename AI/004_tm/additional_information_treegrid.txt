Key Exploration Guidelines:
- There is a grid component with a hierarchy of objects, referred to as treegrid
- The treegrid has the CSS classes: treegrid, datatableworksheet, worksheet
- The treegrid has a hierarchy of objects in the rows; columns display the fields of every object
- Handle partially expanded rows
- Avoid redundant expansions
- Some objects may not be expandable and do not have children.

Special Considerations:
- The expand/collapse control is located to the left
- Use the '>>' ShowDetails button to Open Form View panel
- Use the kebab menu (three vertical dots) for more options: expand, add objects to the tree
- Some tree objets may be collapsed, while others may be expanded
