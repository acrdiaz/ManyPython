Important information about the treeview and treegrid:
- The page contains a treeview component that displays hierarchical nodes
- These nodes are presented in a treegrid format with columns
- Some nodes may be parent folders, others may be child items

Menu Information:
- The page contains multiple types of menus:
  * Main toolbar menu (at the top of the page)
  * Section header menus (at the top of sections)
- The kebab menu is a small popup with only a few options

Key Exploration Guidelines:
- The treeview component manages the hierarchical relationship between nodes
- Nodes in the treeview are displayed as rows in the treegrid
- The treegrid has CSS classes: treegrid, datatableworksheet, worksheet
- The treeview has a hierarchy of nodes; treegrid columns display the fields of every node
- Avoid expanding collapsed nodes
- Some nodes may not be expandable and do not have children

Special Considerations:
- The expand/collapse control is located to the left of each node
- Nodes with children have an expand/collapse button
- Some nodes may be collapsed, while others may be expanded


Technical Details:
- Treeview nodes have data attributes: data-auto-node, data-auto-nodekey, data-auto-nodetitle
- Treegrid rows have data attributes: data-row-id, data-object-type
- Each node has a unique identifier
- The kebab menu button might have attributes like data-auto-button or data-auto-contextualmenu
- The kebab menu popup might have attributes like data-auto-menu or similar
